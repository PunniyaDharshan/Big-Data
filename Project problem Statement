Problem Statement:

An XML file which had informatiion about all the patents of different companies was given. 
The format of the file was not in proper XML. XML parsing will not work here.
A customised algorithm for text mining should be written.
The final data should be in "CSV" format .
Since the "CSV" data will have only dimensional information ,
we will have to design algorithm to extract Factual Information from the given Dimensions

Solution:

I used the SerDe Property in HiveQL to create a table that will accept XML files as source.
Once the data was available in the table, I designed algorithm to perform Text Mining in Hive.
After the data was pulled into CSV another algorithm was designed to extract factual Information.
The same was performed using Python to compare the performance. Hive gave better performance.


All the source codes are attached.
